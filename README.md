A set of eval plugins for the [dart_eval](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_eval) interpreter.
Includes:

* [logging]()
* [http]()
* [latlong2]()
* [country_coder]()
* [fast_geohash]() (TODO)
* [sqflite]()\*
* [share_plus]()\* (TODO)
* [url_launcher]()\*
* [adaptive_dialog]()\*
* [responsive_grid_list]()\*
* [flutter_map]()\*
* [flutter_map_geojson2]()\*

Plugins marked with "\*" require the [flutter_eval]() bindings. This entire package also depends
on Flutter, so splitting it to work with plain Dart might pose a challenge.

Seemingly random, those packages are useful for the [Every Door]() OpenStreetMap editor plugins.

## Usage

Add this package to your dependencies, and do not forget to install the plugins.

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
